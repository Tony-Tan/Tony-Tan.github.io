      <description>Keywords: least squares estimation
Squares of the difference between the output of a predictor and the target are wildly used loss function especially in regression problems:
$$ \ell(\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_i,\boldsymbol{y}_i)=(\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_i-\boldsymbol{y}_i)^T(\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_i-\boldsymbol{y}_i) \tag{1} $$
Linear Regression1 Linear regression is a good problem to begin our machine learning career. Not only because of its easiest form and logic but also it&amp;rsquo;s a good basis from which we can extend to other more complicated methods like nonlinear regression and kernel functions.</description>

      <description>About Me Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Anthony Tan(谭升). I am now living in Shenzhen, China. I&amp;rsquo;m a full-time computer vision algorithm engineer and a part-time individual reinforcement learning researcher. I have had a great interest in artificial intelligence since I watched the movie &amp;ldquo;Iron man&amp;rdquo; when I was a middle school student. And to get deeper into these subjects, I&amp;rsquo;d like to apply for a Ph.D. project on reinforcement learning in the following years.</description>

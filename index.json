This method is also discriminative for it gives directly the class to which the input \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) belongs. Assuming that the linear function\n\\[ y=\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}+w_0\\tag{1} \\]\nis employed as before. Then the threshold function \\(f(\\mathbf{y})=\\begin{cases}1 \u0026amp;\\text{ if } y\\leq 0\\\\0 \u0026amp;\\text{ otherwise }\\end{cases}\\) was employed. If \\(y\u0026lt;0\\) or equivalenttly \\(\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}\\leq -w_0\\) , \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) belongs to \\(\\mathcal{C}_1\\), or it belongs to \\(\\mathcal{C}_2\\).\nThis is an intuitive classification framework, but if such kinds of parameters exist and how to find them out is still a hard problem.\nFrom the linear algebra view, when we set \\(w_0=0\\) the equation (1) can be viewed as the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) projecting on vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\).\nAnd a good parameter vector direction and a threshold may solve this problem. And the measurement of how good the parameter vector direction is has some different candidates.\nDistance Between Class Center The first strategy that comes to us is to maximize the distance between the projections of the centers of different classes.\nThe first step is to get the center of a class \\(\\mathcal{C}_k\\) whose size is \\(N_k\\) by:\n\\[ \\mathbf{m}_k=\\frac{1}{N_k}\\sum_{x_i\\in \\mathcal{C}_k}\\mathbf{x}_i\\tag{2} \\]\nSo the distance between the projections \\(m_1\\), \\(m_2\\) of centers of the two classes, \\(\\mathbf{m}_1\\), \\(\\mathbf{m}_2\\) is:\n\\[ m_1-m_2=\\mathbf{w}^T(\\mathbf{m}_1-\\mathbf{m}_2)\\tag{3} \\]\nAnd for the \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) here is referred to as the direction vector, its margin is \\(1\\):\n\\[ ||\\mathbf{w}||=1\\tag{4} \\]\nWhen \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) has the same direction with \\(\\mathbf{m}_1-\\mathbf{m}_2\\), equation(3) get its maximum value.\nThen the result looks like this:\nThe blue star and blue circle are the center of red stars and green circles, respectively. and the blue arrow is the direction we want in which the projections of center points have the longest distance.\nWith our observation, this line does not give the optimum solution. Because, although the projections of centers have the longest distance on this line, the projections of all sample points scatter into a relatively large region and some of them from different classes have been mixed up.\nThis phenomenon exists in our daily life. For example, when two seats are closed, the people sitting on them do not have enough space(this is the original condition). Then we move the seats and make them a little farther from each other(make the projections of centers far from each other). But this time, two big guys come to sit on them(the projection has a big variance), and the space is still not enough.\nIn our problem, the projections of the points of a class are the big guys. We need to make the projection of centers far away from each other and make the projections of points in one class slender (which means a lower variance) at the same time.\nThe variance of the projected points of class \\(k\\) can be calculated by:\n\\[ s^2_k=\\sum_{n\\in \\mathcal{C}_k}(y_n - m_k)^2\\tag{5} \\]\nand it is also called within-class variance.\nTo make the seat comfortable for people who sit on them, we need to make the seat as far as possible from each other(maximize \\((m_2-m_1)^2\\)) and only allow children to sit(minimize the sum of within-class variance).\nFisher criterion satisfies this requirement:\n\\[ J(\\mathbf{w})=\\frac{(m_2-m_1)^2}{s_1^2+s_2^2}\\tag{6} \\]\nAnd \\(J(\\mathbf{w})\\) in details is:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} J()\u0026amp;=\\ \u0026amp;=\\ \u0026amp;= {_{n_1}(^T_n - ^T1)^2+{n_2}(^T_n - ^T_2)^2}\\\n\u0026amp;= {^T(_{n_1}(_n - _1)(_n - 1)^T+{n_2}(_n - _2)(_n - _2)^T)} \\end{aligned} $$\nAnd we can set:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} S_B \u0026amp;= (\\mathbf{m}_1-\\mathbf{m}_2)(\\mathbf{m}_1-\\mathbf{m}_2)^T\\\\ S_W \u0026amp;= \\sum_{n\\in \\mathcal{C}_1}(\\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{m}_1)(\\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{m}_1)^T+\\sum_{n\\in \\mathcal{C}_2}(\\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{m}_2)(\\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{m}_2)^T \\end{aligned}\\tag{8} \\]\nwhere \\(S_B\\) represents the covariance matrix Between classes, and \\(S_W\\) represents the Within classes covariance.

And we, here, have a look at the behavior of the discriminant function in linear classification.1\nIn the post ‘Least Squares Classification’, we have seen, in a linear classification task, the decision boundary is a line or hyperplane by which we separate two classes. And if our model is based on the decision boundary or, in other words, we separate inputs by a function and a threshold, the model is a discriminant model and the decision boundary is formed by the function and a threshold.\nNow, we are going to talk about what the decision boundaries look like in the \\(K\\)-classes problem when \\(K=2\\) and \\(K\u0026gt;2\\). To illustrate the boundaries, we only consider the 2D(two dimensional) input vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) who has only two components.\nTwo classes The easiest decision boundary comes from 2-dimensional input space which is separated into 2 regions:\nwhose decision boundary is:\n\\[ \\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}+w_0=\\text{ constant }\\tag{1} \\]\nThis equation is equal to \\(\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}+w_0=0\\) because \\(w_0\\) is also a constant, so it can be merged with the r.h.s. constant. Of course, the 1-dimensional input space is easier than 2-dimensional, and its decision boundary is a point.\nLet’s go back to the line, and it has the following properties:\nThe vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) always points to a certain region and is perpendicular to the line. \\(w_0\\) decides the location of the boundary relative to the origin. The perpendicular distance \\(r\\) to the line of a point \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) can be calculated by \\(r=\\frac{y(\\mathbf{x})}{||\\mathbf{w}||}\\) where \\(y(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}+w_0\\)  Because these three properties are all basic concepts of a line, we just prove the third point roughly:\nproof: We set \\(\\mathbf{x}_{\\perp}\\) is the projection of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) on the line.\nWe using the first point that \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is perpendicular to the line and \\(\\frac{\\mathbf{w}}{||\\mathbf{w}||}\\) is the union vector:\n\\[ \\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{x}_{\\perp}+r\\frac{\\mathbf{w}}{||\\mathbf{w}||}\\tag{2} \\]\nand we substitute equation (2) to the line function \\(y(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}+w_0\\) :\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} y(\\mathbf{x})\u0026amp;=\\mathbf{w}^T(\\mathbf{x}_{\\perp}+r\\frac{\\mathbf{w}}{||\\mathbf{w}||})+w_0\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}_{\\perp}+\\mathbf{w}^Tr\\frac{\\mathbf{w}}{||\\mathbf{w}||}+w_0\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\mathbf{w}^Tr\\frac{\\mathbf{w}}{||\\mathbf{w}||}\\\\ \u0026amp;=r\\frac{||\\mathbf{w}||^2}{||\\mathbf{w}||}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\tag{3} \\]\nSo we have\n\\[ r=\\frac{y(\\mathbf{x})}{||\\mathbf{w}||}\\tag{4} \\]\nQ.E.D.\nHowever, augmented vectors \\(\\mathbf{w}= \\begin{bmatrix}w_0\u0026amp;w_1\u0026amp; \\cdots\u0026amp;w_d\\end{bmatrix}^T\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}= \\begin{bmatrix}1\u0026amp;x_1\u0026amp; \\cdots\u0026amp;x_d\\end{bmatrix}^T\\) can cancel \\(w_0\\) of the original boundary equation. So a \\(d+1\\)-dimensional hyperplane that went through the origin could be instea replaced by an \\(d\\)-dimensional hyperplane.\nMultiple Classes Things changed when we consider more than 2 classes. Their boundaries become more complicated, and we have 3 different strategies for this problem intuitively:\n1-versus-the-rest Classifier This strategy needs at least \\(K-1\\) classifiers(boundaries). Each classifier \\(k\\) just decides which side belongs to class \\(k\\) and the other side does not belong to \\(k\\). So when we have two boundaries, like:\nwhere the region \\(R_4\\) is embarrassed, based on the properties of the decision boundary, and the definition of classification in the post‘From Linear Regression to Linear Classification’, region \\(R_4\\) can not belong to \\(\\mathcal{C}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbb{C}_2\\) simultaneously.\nSo the first strategy can work for some regions, but there are some black whole regions where the input \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) belongs to more than one class and some white whole regions where the input \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) belongs to no classes(region \\(R_3\\) could be such a region)\n1-versus-1 classifier Another kind of multiple class boundary is the combination of several 1-versus-1 linear decision boundaries. Both sides of a decision boundary belong to a certain class, not like the 1-versus-rest classifier. And to a \\(K\\) class task, it needs \\(K(K-1)/2\\) binary discriminant functions.\nHowever, the contradiction still exists. Region \\(R_4\\) belongs to class \\(\\mathcal{C}_1\\), \\(\\mathcal{C}_2\\), and \\(\\mathcal{C}_3\\) simultaneously.\nSo this is also not good for all situations.\n\\(K\\) Linear functions We use a set of \\(K\\) linear functions: \\[ \\begin{aligned} y_1(\\mathbf{x})\u0026amp;=\\mathbf{w}^T_1\\mathbf{x}+w_{10}\\\\ y_2(\\mathbf{x})\u0026amp;=\\mathbf{w}^T_2\\mathbf{x}+w_{20}\\\\ \u0026amp;\\vdots \\\\ y_K(\\mathbf{x})\u0026amp;=\\mathbf{w}^T_K\\mathbf{x}+w_{K0}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\tag{5} \\]\nand an input belongs to \\(k\\) when \\(y_k(\\mathbf{x})\u0026gt;y_j(\\mathbf{x})\\) where \\(j\\in \\{1,2,\\cdots,K\\}\\) that \\(j\\neq k\\). According to this definition, the decision boundary between class \\(k\\) and class \\(j\\) is \\(y_k(\\mathbf{x})=y_j(\\mathbf{x})\\) where \\(k,j\\in\\{1,2,\\cdots,K\\}\\) and \\(j\\neq k\\). Then a decision hyperplane is defined as:\n\\[ (\\mathbf{w}_k-\\mathbf{w}_j)^T\\mathbf{x}+(w_{k0}-w_{j0})=0\\tag{6} \\]\nThese decision boundaries separate the input spaces into \\(K\\) single connect, convex regions.\nproof: choose two points in the region \\(k\\) that \\(k\\in \\{1,2,\\cdots,K\\}\\). \\(\\mathbf{x}_A\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_B\\) are two points in the region. An arbitrary point on the line between \\(\\mathbf{x}_A\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_B\\) can be written as \\(\\mathbf{x}\u0026#39;=\\lambda \\mathbf{x}_A + (1-\\lambda)\\mathbf{x}_B\\) where \\(0\\leq\\lambda\\leq1\\). For the linearity of \\(y_k(\\mathbf{x})\\) we have:\n\\[ y_k(\\mathbf{x}\u0026#39;)=\\lambda y_k(\\mathbf{x}_A) + (1-\\lambda)y_k(\\mathbf{x}_B)\\tag{7} \\]\nBecause \\(\\mathbf{x}_A\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_B\\) belong to class \\(k\\), \\(y_k(\\mathbf{x}_A)\u0026gt;y_j(\\mathbf{x}_A)\\) and \\(y_k(\\mathbf{x}_B)\u0026gt;y_j(\\mathbf{x}_B)\\) where \\(j\\neq k\\). Then \\(y_k(\\mathbf{x}\u0026#39;)\u0026gt;y_j(\\mathbf{x}\u0026#39;)\\) and the region of class \\(k\\) is convex.\nQ.E.D\nThe last strategy seems good. And what we should do is estimate the parameters of the model. The most famous approaches that will study are: 1. Least square 2. Fisher’s linear discriminant 3.

And what we could do to extend the least-squares method to classification are:\nmodifying the type of output and designing a discriminative model  Modifying the type of output is to convert the class label into a number, like ‘apple’ to \\(1\\), ‘orange’ to 0.

So we set the largest value to be 1 and others 0.\nWe had discussed the linear regression with the least squares in a ‘single-target’ regression problem. And that idea can also be employed in the multiple targets regression. And these \\(K\\) parameter vectors \\(\\mathbf{w}_i\\) can be calculated simultaneously. We can rewrite the equation (1) into the matrix form:\n\\[ \\mathbf{y}(\\mathbf{x})=W^T\\mathbf{x}\\tag{2} \\]\nwhere the \\(i\\)th column of \\(W\\) is \\(\\mathbf{w}_i\\)\nThen we employ the least square method for a sample:\n\\[ \\{(\\mathbf{x}_1,\\mathbf{t}_1),(\\mathbf{x}_2,\\mathbf{t}_2),\\cdots,(\\mathbf{x}_m,\\mathbf{t}_m)\\} \\tag{3} \\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{t}\\) is a \\(K\\)-dimensional target consisting of \\(k-1\\) 0’s and one ‘1’.

And we can even verify whether this apple is tasty or not.\nThen the goal of classification is clear:\n Assign input \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) to a certain class of \\(K\\) available classes. And \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) must belong to one and only one class.\n The input \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), like the input of regression, can be a feature or basis function and can be continuous or discrete. However, its output is discrete. Let’s go back to the example that we can tell apple, orange, and pineapple apart. The difference between apple and orange and the difference between apple and pineapple can not be compared, because the distance(it is the mathematical name of difference) itself had no means.\nA Binary Code Scheme we can not calculate apple and orange directly. So a usual first step in the classification task is mapping the target or labels of an example into a number, like \\(1\\) for the apple and \\(2\\) for the orange.\nA binary code scheme is another way to code targets.\nFor a two classes mission, the numerical labels can be:\n\\[ \\mathcal{C}_1=0 \\text{ and }\\mathcal{C}_2=1\\tag{1} \\]\nIt’s equal to:\n\\[ \\mathcal{C}_1=1 \\text{ and }\\mathcal{C}_2=0\\tag{2} \\]\nAnd to a \\(K\\) classes target, the binary code scheme is:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathcal{C}_1 \u0026amp;= \\{1,0,\\cdots,0\\}\\\\ \\mathcal{C}_2 \u0026amp;= \\{0,1,\\cdots,0\\}\\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp; \\\\ \\mathcal{C}_K \u0026amp;= \\{0,0,\\cdots,1\\}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\tag{3} \\]\nThe \\(n\\)-dimensional input \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is called the input space. In the classification task, the input points can be separated by the targets, and these parts of space are called decision regions and the boundaries between decision regions are called decision boundaries or decision surfaces. When the decision boundary is linear, the task is called linear classification.\nThere are roughly two kinds of procedures for classification:\nDiscriminant Function: assign input \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) to a certain class directly. We infer \\(\\Pr(\\mathcal{C}_k|\\mathbf{x})\\) firstly and then make a decision based on the posterior probability. Inference of \\(\\Pr(\\mathcal{C}_k|\\mathbf{x})\\) was calculated firstly \\(\\Pr(\\mathcal{C}_k|\\mathbf{x})\\) can also be calculated by Bayesian Theorem \\(\\Pr(\\mathcal{C}_k|\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{\\Pr(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathcal{C}_k)\\Pr(\\mathcal{C}_k)}{\\Pr(\\mathbf{x})}=\\frac{\\Pr(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathcal{C}_k)\\Pr(\\mathcal{C}_k)}{\\sum_k \\Pr(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathcal{C}_k)\\Pr(\\mathcal{C}_k)}\\)   They are the discriminate model and generative model, respectively.\nLinear Classification In the regression problem, the output of the linear function:\n\\[ \\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}+b\\tag{4} \\]\nis approximate of the target. But in the classification task, we want the output to be the class to which the input \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) belongs. However, the output of the linear function is always continuous. This output is more like the posterior probability, say \\(\\Pr({\\mathcal{C}_i|\\mathbf{x}})\\) rather than the discrete class label. To generate a class label output, function \\(f(\\cdot)\\) which is called ‘action function’ in machine learning was employed. For example, we can choose a threshold function as the active function:\n\\[ y(\\mathbf{x})=f(\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}+b)\\tag{5} \\]\nwhere \\(f(\\cdot)\\) is the threshold function:\n\\[ f(x) = \\begin{cases}1\u0026amp;x\\geq c\\\\0\u0026amp;\\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}\\tag{6} \\] where \\(c\\) is a constant.\nIn this case, the boundary is \\(\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}+b = c\\), and it is a line. So we call this kind of model ‘linear classification’. The input \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) can be replaced by a basis function \\(\\phi(\\mathbf{x})\\) as mentioned in the polynomial regression.\nReferences  Bishop, Christopher M.

Because in an approximation task, ‘error’ occurs by chance and always exists, and ‘loss’ is a good word to represent the difference. The loss can be written generally as function \\(\\ell(f(\\mathbf{x}),t)\\). Intuitively, the smaller the loss, the better the approximation.\nSo the expectation of loss:\n\\[ \\mathbb E[\\ell]=\\int\\int \\ell(f(\\mathbf{x}),t)p(\\mathbf{x},t)d \\mathbf{x}dt\\tag{1} \\]\nshould be as small as possible.\nIn probability viewpoint, the input vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), target \\(t\\) and parameters in function(model) \\(f(\\cdot)\\) are all random variables. Then the expectation of loss function may exist.\nConsidering the square error loss function \\(e=(f(\\mathbf{x})-t)^2\\), it is a usual measure of the difference between the prediction and the target. And substitute the loss function into equation (1), we have:\n\\[ \\mathbb E[\\ell]=\\int\\int (f(\\mathbf{x})-t)^2p(\\mathbf{x},t)d \\mathbf{x}dt\\tag{2} \\]\nTo minimize this function, we could use Euler-Lagrange equation, Fundamental theorem of calculus and Fubini’s theorem:\nFubini’s theorem told us that we can change the order of integration: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbb E[\\ell]\u0026amp;=\\int\\int (f(\\mathbf{x})-t)^2p(\\mathbf{x},t)d \\mathbf{x}dt\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\int\\int (f(\\mathbf{x})-t)^2p(\\mathbf{x},t)dtd \\mathbf{x} \\end{aligned}\\tag{3} \\]\nAccording to the Euler-Lagrange equation, we first create a new function \\(G(x,f,f\u0026#39;)\\): \\[ G(x,f,f\u0026#39;)= \\int (f(\\mathbf{x})-t)^2p(\\mathbf{x},t)dt\\tag{4} \\]\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation is used to minimize the equation (2): \\[ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial f}-\\frac{d}{dx}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial f\u0026#39;}=0\\tag{5} \\]\nBecause there is no \\(y\u0026#39;\\) component in function \\(G()\\). Then the equation: \\[ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial f}=0\\tag{6} \\] becomes the necessary condition to minimize the equation (2):\n\\[ 2\\int (f(\\mathbf{x})-t)p(\\mathbf{x},t)dt=0 \\tag{7} \\]\nRearrange the equation (7), and we get a good predictor that can minimize the square loss function :\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\int (f(\\mathbf{x})-t)p(\\mathbf{x},t)dt\u0026amp;=0\\\\ \\int f(\\mathbf{x})p(\\mathbf{x},t)dt-\\int tp(\\mathbf{x},t)dt\u0026amp;=0\\\\ f(\\mathbf{x})\\int p(\\mathbf{x},t)dt\u0026amp;=\\int tp(\\mathbf{x},t)dt\\\\ f(\\mathbf{x})\u0026amp;=\\frac{\\int tp(\\mathbf{x},t)dt}{\\int p(\\mathbf{x},t)dt}\\\\ f(\\mathbf{x})\u0026amp;=\\frac{\\int tp(\\mathbf{x},t)dt}{p(\\mathbf{x})}\\\\ f(\\mathbf{x})\u0026amp;=\\int tp(t|\\mathbf{x})dt\\\\ f(\\mathbf{x})\u0026amp;= \\mathbb{E}_t[t|\\mathbf{x}] \\end{aligned}\\tag{8} \\]\nWe finally find the expectation of \\(t\\) given \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is the optimum solution. The expectation of \\(t\\) given \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is also called the regression function.\nA small summary: \\(\\mathbb{E}[t| \\mathbf{x}]\\) is a good estimate of \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\)\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation Generally, we assume that there is a generator behind the data:\n\\[ t=g(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{w})+\\epsilon\\tag{9} \\]\nwhere the function \\(g(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{w})\\) is a deterministic function, \\(t\\) is the target variable and \\(\\epsilon\\) is zero mean Gaussian random variable with percision \\(\\beta\\) which is the inverse variance. Because of the property of Gaussian distribution, \\(t\\) has a Gaussian distribution, with mean(expectation) \\(g(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{w})\\) and percesion \\(\\beta\\). And recalling the standard form of Gaussian distribution:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\Pr(t|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{w},\\beta)\u0026amp;=\\mathcal{N}(t|g(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{w}),\\beta^{-1})\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{1}{2}(\\beta(x-\\mu)^2)} \\end{aligned}\\tag{10} \\]\nOur task here is to approximate the generator in equation (9) with a linear function. Somehow, when we use the square loss function, the optimum solution for this task is \\(\\mathbb{E}[t|\\mathbf{x}]\\) to equation (8).\nthe solution to equation (10) is:\n\\[ \\mathbb{E}[t|\\mathbf{x}]=g(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{w})\\tag{11} \\]\nWe set the linear model as: \\[ f(x)=\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}+b\\tag{12} \\]\nand this can be converted to:\n\\[ f(x)= \\begin{bmatrix} b\u0026amp;\\mathbf{w}^T \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\ \\mathbf{x} \\end{bmatrix}=\\mathbf{w}_a^T\\mathbf{x}_a \\tag{13} \\]\nfor short, we just write the \\(\\mathbf{w}_a\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_a\\) as \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). Then the linear model becomes:\n\\[ f(x)=\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}\\tag{14} \\]\nAs we mentioned above we consider all the parameter as a random variable, then the conditioned distribution of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is \\(\\Pr(\\mathbf{w}|\\mathbf{t},\\beta)\\). \\(X\\) or \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) was omitted in the condition because it does not affect the result at all. And the Bayesian theorem told us:\n\\[ \\Pr(\\mathbf{w}|\\mathbf{t},\\beta)=\\frac{\\Pr( \\mathbf{t}|\\mathbf{w},\\beta) \\Pr(\\mathbf{w})} {\\Pr(\\mathbf{t})}=\\frac{\\text{Likelihood}\\times \\text{Prior}}{\\text{Evidence}}\\tag{15} \\]\nWe want to find the \\(\\mathbf{w}^{\\star}\\) that maximise the posterior probability \\(\\Pr(\\mathbf{w}|\\mathbf{t},\\beta)\\). Because \\(\\Pr(\\mathbf{t})\\) and \\(\\Pr(\\mathbf{w})\\) are constant. Then the maximum of likelihood \\(\\Pr(\\mathbf{t}|\\mathbf{w},\\beta)\\) maximise the posterior probability.\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\Pr(\\mathbf{t}|\\mathbf{w},\\beta)\u0026amp;=\\Pi_{i=0}^{N}\\mathcal{N}(t_i|\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}_i,\\beta^{-1})\\\\ \\ln \\Pr(\\mathbf{t}|\\mathbf{w},\\beta)\u0026amp;=\\sum_{i=0}^{N}\\ln \\mathcal{N}(t_i|\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}_i,\\beta^{-1})\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\sum_{i=0}^{N}\\ln \\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{1}{2}(\\beta(t_i-\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}_i)^2)}\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\sum_{i=0}^{N} \\ln \\beta - \\sum_{i=0}^{N} \\ln \\sqrt{2\\pi} - \\frac{1}{2}\\beta\\sum_{i=0}^{N}(t_i-\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}_i)^2 \\end{aligned}\\tag{16} \\]\nThis gives us a wonderful result.\nWe can only control the component \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\beta\\sum_{i=0}^{N}(t_i-\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}_i)^2\\) of the last line of equation(16), because \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{N} \\ln \\beta\\) and \\(- \\sum_{i=0}^{N} \\ln \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\) were decided by the assumptions. In other words, to maximise the likelihood, we just need to minimise:\n\\[ \\sum_{i=0}^{N}(t_i-\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}_i)^2\\tag{17} \\]\nThis was just to minimize the sum of squares. Then this optimization problem went back to the least square problem.\nLeast Square Estimation and Maximum Likelihood Estimation When we assume there is a generator:\n\\[ t=g(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{w})+\\epsilon\\tag{18} \\]\nbehind the data, and \\(\\epsilon\\) has a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with any precision \\(\\beta\\), the maximum likelihood estimation finally converts to the least square estimation. This is not only worked for linear regression because we did not assume what \\(g(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{w})\\) is.\nHowever, when the \\(\\epsilon\\) has a different distribution but not Gaussian distribution, the least square estimation will not be the optimum solution for maximum likelihood estimation.\nReferences  Bishop, Christopher M.

According to the definition of linearity, we can develop the simplest linear regression model:\n\\[ Y\\sim w_1X+w_0\\tag{1} \\]\nwhere the symbol \\(\\sim\\) is read as “is approximately modeled as”. Equation (1) can also be described as “regressing \\(Y\\) on \\(X\\)(or \\(Y\\) onto \\(X\\))”.\nGo back to the example that was given in “An Introduction to Linear Regression”. Combining with the equation (1), we get a model of the budget for TV advertisement and sales:\n\\[ \\text{Sales}=w_1\\times \\text{TV}+ w_0\\tag{2} \\]\nAssuming we have a machine here, which can turn grain into flour, the input is the grain, \\(X\\) in equation (1), and the output is flour, \\(Y\\). Accordingly, \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is the gears in the machine.\nThen the mathematically model is:\n\\[ y=\\hat{w_1}x+\\hat{w_0}\\tag{3} \\]\nThe hat symbol “\\(\\;\\hat{}\\;\\)” is used to present that this variable is a prediction, which means it is not the true value of the variable but a conjecture through certain mathematical strategies or methods else.\nThen, a new input \\(x_i\\) has its prediction:\n\\[ \\hat{y}_i=\\hat{w_1}x_i+\\hat{w_0}\\tag{4} \\]\nStatistical learning mainly studies \\(\\begin{bmatrix}\\hat{w_0}\\\\\\hat{w_1}\\end{bmatrix}\\) but machine learning concerns more about \\(\\hat{y}\\) All of them were based on the observed data.\nOnce we got this model, what we do next is estimating the parameters\nEstimating the Parameters For the advertisement task, what we have are a linear regression model equation(2) and a set of observations:\n\\[ \\{(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3),\\dots,(x_n,y_n)\\}\\tag{5} \\]\nwhich is also known as training set. By the way, \\(x_i\\) in equation (5) is a sample of \\(X\\) and so is \\(y_i\\) of \\(Y\\). \\(n\\) is the size of the training set, the number of observations pairs.\nThe method we employed here is based on a measure of the “closeness” of the outputs of the model to the observed target (\\(y\\)s in set (5)). By far, the most used method is the “least squares criterion”.\nThe outputs \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) of current model(parameters) to every input \\(x_i\\) are:\n\\[ \\{(x_1,\\hat{y}_1),(x_2,\\hat{y}_2),(x_3,\\hat{y}_3),\\dots,(x_n,\\hat{y}_n)\\}\\tag{6} \\]\nand the difference between \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) is called residual and written as \\(e_i\\):\n\\[ e_i=y_i-\\hat{y}_i\\tag{7} \\]\n\\(y_i\\) is the target, which is the value our model is trying to achieve. So, the smaller the \\(|e_i|\\) is, the better the model is. Because the absolute operation is not a good analytic operation, we replace it with the quadratic operation:\n\\[ \\mathcal{L}_\\text{RSS}=e_1^2+e_2^2+\\dots+e_n^2\\tag{8} \\]\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_\\text{RSS}\\) means “Residual Sum of Squares”, the sum of total square residual. And to find a better model, we need to minimize the sum of the total residual. In machine learning, this is called loss function.\nNow we take equations (4),(7) into (8):\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathcal{L}_\\text{RSS}=\u0026amp;(y_1-\\hat{w_1}x_1-\\hat{w_0})^2+(y_2-\\hat{w_1}x_2-\\hat{w_0})^2+\\\\ \u0026amp;\\dots+(y_n-\\hat{w_1}x_n-\\hat{w_0})^2\\\\ =\u0026amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{w_1}x_i-\\hat{w_0})^2 \\end{aligned}\\tag{9} \\]\nTo minimize the function “\\(\\mathcal{L}_\\text{RSS}\\)”, the calculus told us the possible minimum(maximum) points always stay at stationary points. And the stationary points are the points where the derivative of the function is zero. Remember that the minimum(maximum) points must be stationary points, but the stationary point is not necessary to be a minimum(maximum) point. For more information, ‘Numerical Optimization’ is a good book.\nSince the ‘\\(\\mathcal{L}_\\text{RSS}\\)’ is a function of a vector \\(\\begin{bmatrix}w_0\u0026amp;w_1\\end{bmatrix}^T\\), the derivative is replaced by partial derivative. As the ‘\\(\\mathcal{L}_\\text{RSS}\\)’ is just a simple quadric surface, the minimum or maximum exists, and there is one and only one stationary point.\nThen our mission to find the best parameters for the regression has been converted to calculus the solution of the function system that the derivative(partial derivative) is set to zero.\nThe partial derivative of \\(\\hat{w_1}\\) is\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial{\\mathcal{L}_\\text{RSS}}}{\\partial{\\hat{w_1}}}=\u0026amp;-2\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i(y_i-\\hat{w_1}x_i-\\hat{w_0})\\\\ =\u0026amp;-2(\\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i-\\hat{w_1}\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2-\\hat{w_0}\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i) \\end{aligned}\\tag{10} \\]\nand derivative of \\(\\hat{w_0}\\) is:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial{\\mathcal{L}_\\text{RSS}}}{\\partial{\\hat{w_0}}}=\u0026amp;-2\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{w_1}x_i-\\hat{w_0})\\\\ =\u0026amp;-2(\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i-\\hat{w_1}\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i-\\sum_{i=1}^n\\hat{w_0}) \\end{aligned}\\tag{11} \\]\nSet both of them to zero and we can get:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial{\\mathcal{L}_\\text{RSS}}}{\\partial{\\hat{w_0}}}\u0026amp;=0\\\\ \\hat{w_0} \u0026amp;=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i-\\hat{w_1}\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i}{n}\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\bar{y}-\\hat{w_1}\\bar{x} \\end{aligned}\\tag{12} \\]\nand\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial{\\mathcal{L}_\\text{RSS}}}{\\partial{\\hat{w_1}}}\u0026amp;=0\\\\ \\hat{w_1}\u0026amp;=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i-\\hat{w_0}\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2} \\end{aligned}\\tag{13} \\]\nTo get a equation of \\(\\hat{w_1}\\) independently, we take equation(13) to equation(12):\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial{\\mathcal{L}_\\text{RSS}}}{\\partial{\\hat{w_1}}}\u0026amp;=0\\\\ \\hat{w_1}\u0026amp;=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i(y_i-\\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i(x_i-\\bar{x})} \\end{aligned}\\tag{14} \\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{x}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i}{n}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i}{n}\\)\nBy the way, equation (14) has another form:\n\\[ \\hat{w_1}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})(x_i-\\bar{x})}\\tag{15} \\]\nand they are equal.\nDiagrams and Code Using python to demonstrate our result Equ.

And it was usually used to predict some responses to some inputs(predictors).\nMachine Learning and Statistical Learning Machine learning and statistical learning are similar but have some distinctions. In machine learning, models, regression models, or classification models, are used to predict the outputs of the new incoming inputs.\nIn contrast, in statistical learning, regression and classification are employed to model the data to find out the hidden relations among the inputs. In other words, the models of data, no matter they are regression or classification, or something else. They are used to analyze the mechanism behind the data.\n“Linear” Linear is a property of the operation \\(f(\\cdot)\\), which has the following two properties:\n\\(f(a\\mathbf{x})=af(\\mathbf{x})\\) \\(f(\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{y})=f(\\mathbf{x})+f(\\mathbf{y})\\)  where \\(a\\) is a scalar. Then we say \\(f(\\cdot)\\) is linear or \\(f(\\cdot)\\) has a linearity property.\nThe linear operation can be represented as a matrix. And when a 2-dimensional linear operation was drawn on the paper, it is a line. Maybe that is why it is named linear, I guess.\n“Regression” In statistical or machine learning, regression is a crucial part of the whole field. And, the other part is the well-known classification. If we have a close look at the outputs data type, one distinction between them is that the output of regression is continuous but the output of classification is discrete.\nWhat is linear regression Linear regression is a regression model. All parameters in the model are linear, like:\n\\[ f(\\mathbf{x})=w_1x_1+w_2x_2+w_3x_3\\tag{1} \\]\nwhere the \\(w_n\\) where \\(n=1,2,3\\) are the parameters of the model, the output \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\) can be written as \\(t\\) for 1-deminsional outputs (or \\(\\mathbf{t}\\) for multi-deminsional outputs).\n\\(f(\\mathbf{w})\\) is linear:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} f(a\\cdot\\mathbf{w})\u0026amp;=aw_1x_1+aw_2x_2+aw_3x_3=a\\cdot f(\\mathbf{w}) \\\\ f(\\mathbf{w}+\\mathbf{v})\u0026amp;=(w_1+v_1)x_1+(w_2+v_2)x_2+(w_3+v_3)x_3\\\\ \u0026amp;=w_1x_1+v_1x_1+w_2x_2+v_2x_2+w_3x_3+v_3x_3\\\\ \u0026amp;=f(\\mathbf{w})+f(\\mathbf{v}) \\end{aligned}\\tag{2} \\]\nwhere \\(a\\) is a scalar, and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is in the same space with \\(\\mathbf{w}\\)\nQ.E.D\nThere is also another view that the linear property of models is also for \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), the input.\nBut the following model\n\\[ t=f(\\mathbf{x})=w_1\\log(x_1)+w_2\\sin(x_2)\\tag{3} \\]\nis a case of linear regression problem in our definition. But from the second point of view, it is not linear for inputs \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). However, this is not an unsolvable contradiction. If we use:\n\\[ y_1= \\log(x_1)\\\\ y_2= \\sin(x_2)\\tag{4} \\]\nto replace the \\(\\log\\) and \\(\\sin\\) in equation (3), we get again\n\\[ t=f(\\mathbf{y})=w_1y_1+w_2y_2\\tag{5} \\]\na linear operation for both input \\(\\mathbf{y}=\\begin{bmatrix}y_1\\;y_2\\end{bmatrix}^T\\) and parameters \\(\\mathbf{z}\\) .\nThe tranformation, equation(4), is called feature extraction. \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is called features, and \\(\\log\\) and \\(\\sin\\) are called basis functions\nAn Example This example is taken from (James20131), It is about the sale between different kinds of advertisements. I downloaded the data set from http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/data.html. It’s a CSV file, including 200 rows. Here I draw 3 pictures using ‘matplotlib’ to make the data more visible. They are advertisements for ‘TV’, ‘Radio’, ‘Newspaper’ to ‘Sales’ respectively.\nFrom these figures, we can find TV ads and Sales looks like having a stronger relationship than radio ads and sales. However, the Newspaper ads and Sales look independent.\nFor statistical learning, we should take statistical methods to investigate the relation in the data. And in machine learning, to a certain input, predicting an output is what we are concerned.\nWhy Linear Regression Linear regression has been used for more than 200 years, and it’s always been our first class of statistical learning or machine learning. Here we list 3 practical elements of linear regression, which are essential for the whole subject:\nIt is still working in some areas. Although more complicated models have been built, they could not be replaced totally. It is a good jump-off point to the other more feasible and adorable models, which may be an extension or generation of naive linear regression Linear regression is easy, so it is possible to be analyzed mathematically.  This is why linear regression is always our first step to learn machine learning and statistical learning. And by now, this works pretty well.\nA Probabilistic View Machine learning or statistical learning can be described from two different views - Bayesian and Frequentist. They both worked well for some different instances, but they also have their limitations. The Bayesian view of the linear regression will be talked about as well later.\nBayesian statisticians thought the input \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), the output \\(t\\), and the parameter \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) are all random variables, while the frequentist does not think so. Bayesian statisticians predict the unknown input \\(\\mathbf{x}_0\\) by forming the distribution \\(\\mathbb{P}(t_0|\\mathbf{x}_0)\\) and then sampling from it. To achieve this goal, we must build the \\(\\mathbb{P}(t|\\mathbf{x})\\) firstly. This is the modeling progress, or we can call it learning progress.\nReferences  James, Gareth, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. An introduction to statistical learning.

      <description>Preliminaries An Introduction to Linear Regression A Simple Linear Regression Bayesian theorem Feature extraction  Recall Linear Regression The goal of a regression problem is to find out a function or hypothesis that given an input \(\mathbf{x}\), it can make a prediction \(\hat{y}\) to estimate the target. Both the target \(y\) and prediction \(\hat{y}\) here are continuous. They have the properties of numbers1:
 Consider 3 inputs \(\mathbf{x}_1\), \(\mathbf{x}_2\) and \(\mathbf{x}_3\) and their coresponding targets are \(y_1=0\), \(y_2=1\) and \(y_3=2\).</description>

      <description>Preliminaries  linear classifier An Introduction to Neural Networks   Theory and Notation1 We are not able to build any artificial cells up to now. It seems impossible to build a neuron network through biological materials manually, either. To investigate the ability of neurons we have built mathematical models of the neuron. These models have been assigned a number of neuron-like properties. However, there must be a balance between the number of properties contained by the mathemetical models and the current computational abilities of the machines.</description>

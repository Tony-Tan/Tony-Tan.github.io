      <description>Preliminaries Numerical Optimization  necessary conditions for maximum  K-means algorithm Fisher Linear Discriminant  Clustering Problem1 The first thing we should do before introducing the algorithm is to make the task clear. A mathematical form is usually the best way.
Clustering is a kind of unsupervised learning task. So there is no correct or incorrect solution because there is no teacher or target in the task. Clustering is similar to classification during predicting since the output of clustering and classification are discrete.</description>

      <description>Preliminaries linear regression Maximum Likelihood Estimation Gaussian Distribution Conditional Distribution  From Supervised to Unsupervised Learning1 We have discussed many machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, linear classification, neural network models, and e.t.c, till now. However, most of them are supervised learning, which means a teacher is leading the models to bias toward a certain task. In these problems our attention was on the probability distribution of parameters given inputs, outputs, and models:</description>

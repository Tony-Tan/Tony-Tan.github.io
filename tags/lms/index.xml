      <description>Preliminaries Performance learning Perceptron learning rule Supervised Hebbian learning LMS  Form LMS to Backpropagation1 The LMS algorithm is a kind of ‘performance learning’. And we have studied several learning rules(algorithms) till now, such as ‘Perceptron learning rule’ and ‘Supervised Hebbian learning’. And they were based on the idea of the physical mechanism of biological neuron networks.
Then performance learning was represented. Because of its outstanding performance, we go further and further away from natural intelligence into performance learning.</description>

      <description>Preliminaries ‘Performance Surfaces and Optimum Points’ Linear algebra stochastic approximation Probability Theory  ADALINE, LMS, and Widrow-Hoff learning1 Performance learning had been discussed. But we have not used it in any neural network. In this post, we talk about an important application of performance learning. And this new neural network was invented by Frank Widrow and his graduate student Marcian Hoff in 1960. It was almost the same time as Perceptron was developed which had been discussed in ‘Perceptron Learning Rule’.</description>

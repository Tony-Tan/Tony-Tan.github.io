      <description>Preliminaries ‘steepest descent algorithm’ Linear Algebra Calculus 1,2  Newton’s Method1 Taylor series gives us the conditions for minimum points based on both first-order items and the second-order item. And first-order item approximation of a performance index function produced a powerful algorithm for locating the minimum points which we call ‘steepest descent algorithm’.
Now we want to have an insight into the second-order approximation of a function to find out whether there is an algorithm that can also work as a guide to the minimum points.</description>

      <description>Preliminaries ‘An Introduction to Performance Optimization’ Linear algebra Calculus 1,2  Direction Based Algorithm and a Variation1 This post describes a direction searching algorithm(\(\mathbf{x}_{k}\)). And its variation gives a way to estimate step length (\(\alpha_k\)).
Steepest Descent To find the minimum points of a performance index by an iterative algorithm, we want to decrease the value of the performance index step by step which looks like going down from the top of the hill.</description>

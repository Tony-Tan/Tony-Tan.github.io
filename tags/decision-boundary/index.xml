      <description>Preliminaries linear algebra   inner multiplication projection  Idea of Fisher linear discriminant1 ‘Least-square method’ in classification can only deal with a small set of tasks. That is because it was designed for the regression task. Then we come to the famous Fisher linear discriminant. This method is also discriminative for it gives directly the class to which the input \(\mathbf{x}\) belongs. Assuming that the linear function
\[ y=\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}+w_0\tag{1} \]</description>

      <description>Preliminaries convex definition linear algebra   vector length vector direction  Discriminant Function in Classification The discriminant function or discriminant model is on the other side of the generative model. And we, here, have a look at the behavior of the discriminant function in linear classification.1
In the post ‘Least Squares Classification’, we have seen, in a linear classification task, the decision boundary is a line or hyperplane by which we separate two classes.</description>

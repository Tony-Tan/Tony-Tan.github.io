      <description>Preliminaries ‘An Introduction to Backpropagation and Multilayer Perceptrons’ ‘The Backpropagation Algorithm’  Speed Backpropagation up 1 BP algorithm has been described in ‘An Introduction to Backpropagation and Multilayer Perceptrons’. And the implementation of the BP algorithm has been recorded at ‘The Backpropagation Algorithm’. BP has worked in many applications for many years, but there are too many drawbacks in the process. The basic BP algorithm is too slow for most practical applications that it might take days or even weeks in training.</description>

      <description>Preliminaries Bayesian Theorem  Bayesian Model Averaging(BMA)1 Bayesian model averaging(BMA) is another wildly used method that is very like a combining model. However, the difference between BMA and combining models is also significant.
A Bayesian model averaging is a Bayesian formula in which the random variable are models(hypothesizes) \(h=1,2,\cdots,H\) with prior probability \(\Pr(h)\), then the marginal distribution over data \(X\) is:
\[ \Pr(X)=\sum_{h=1}^{H}\Pr(X|h)\Pr(h) \]
And the MBA is used to select a model(hypothesis) that can model the data best through Bayesian theory.</description>

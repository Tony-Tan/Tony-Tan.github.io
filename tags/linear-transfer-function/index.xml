      <description>Preliminaries linear classifier An Introduction to Neural Networks  Theory and Notation1 We are not able to build any artificial cells up to now. It seems impossible to build a neuron network through biological materials manually, either. To investigate the ability of neurons we have built mathematical models of the neuron. These models have been assigned a number of neuron-like properties. However, there must be a balance between the number of properties contained by the mathematical models and the current computational abilities of the machines.</description>

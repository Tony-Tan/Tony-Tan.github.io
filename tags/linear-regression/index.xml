      <description>Priliminaries A Simple Linear Regression Least Squares Estimation  Extending Linear Regression with Features1 The original linear regression is in the form:
\[ \begin{aligned} y(\mathbf{x})&amp;amp;= b + \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}\\ &amp;amp;=w_01 + w_1x_1+ w_2x_2+\cdots + w_{m+1}x_{m+1} \end{aligned}\tag{1} \]
where the input vector \(\mathbf{x}\) and parameter \(\mathbf{w}\) are \(m\)-dimension vectors whose first components are \(1\) and bias \(w_0=b\) respectively. This equation is linear for both the input vector and parameter vector. Then an idea come to us, if we set \(x_i=\phi_i(\mathbf{x})\) then equation (1) convert to:</description>

      <description>Priliminaries A Simple Linear Regression Least Squares Estimation linear algebra  Square Loss Function for Regression1 For any input \(\mathbf{x}\), our goal in a regression task is to give a prediction \(\hat{y}=f(\mathbf{x})\) to approximate target \(t\) where the function \(f(\cdot)\) is the chosen hypothesis or model as mentioned in the post https://anthony-tan.com/A-Simple-Linear-Regression/.
The difference between \(t\) and \(\hat{y}\) can be called ‘error’ or more precisely ‘loss’. Because in an approximation task, ‘error’ occurs by chance and always exists, and ‘loss’ is a good word to represent the difference.</description>

      <description>Priliminaries A Simple Linear Regression the column space  Another Example of Linear Regression 1 In the blog A Simple Linear Regression, squares of the difference between the output of a predictor and the target were used as a loss function in a regression problem. And it could be also written as:
\[ \ell(\hat{\mathbf{y}}_i,\mathbf{y}_i)=(\hat{\mathbf{y}}_i-\mathbf{y}_i)^T(\hat{\mathbf{y}}_i-\mathbf{y}_i) \tag{1} \]
The linear regression model in a matrix form is:
\[ y=\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{b}\tag{2} \]
What we do in this post is analyze the least-squares methods from two different viewpoints</description>

      <description>Preliminaries Linear Algebra(the concepts of space, vector) Calculus An Introduction to Linear Regression  Notations of Linear Regression1 We have already created a simple linear model in the post “An Introduction to Linear Regression”. According to the definition of linearity, we can develop the simplest linear regression model:
\[ Y\sim w_1X+w_0\tag{1} \]
where the symbol \(\sim\) is read as “is approximately modeled as”. Equation (1) can also be described as “regressing \(Y\) on \(X\)(or \(Y\) onto \(X\))”.</description>

      <description>Preliminariess Linear Algebra(the concepts of space, vector) Calculus  What is Linear Regression Linear regression is a basic idea in statistical and machine learning based on the linear combination. And it was usually used to predict some responses to some inputs(predictors).
Machine Learning and Statistical Learning Machine learning and statistical learning are similar but have some distinctions. In machine learning, models, regression models, or classification models, are used to predict the outputs of the new incoming inputs.</description>
